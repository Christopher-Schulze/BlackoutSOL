# BlackoutSOL - Usability Guide

*Last updated: May 17, 2025*

## Introduction

BlackoutSOL is an advanced privacy-enhancing solution for Solana transactions, designed to provide strong anonymity guarantees while maintaining ease of use. This document outlines how to effectively use BlackoutSOL, with special emphasis on the multi-wallet distribution feature for enhanced privacy.

## Core Concepts

### Privacy Through Anonymity

BlackoutSOL achieves transaction privacy through a sophisticated multi-hop routing system that breaks the on-chain connection between sender and recipient. Key privacy features include:

- **Multi-hop Routing**: Each transaction passes through 4 hops, making it impossible to trace the flow of funds
- **Split Distribution**: Funds are split into multiple paths, further obfuscating the transaction flow
- **Fake Splits**: In addition to real transaction paths, 44 fake paths are created as decoys
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Cryptographic proofs validate transactions without revealing sensitive information

### Multi-Wallet Distribution

A powerful privacy enhancement is the ability to distribute the final amount across 3-6 different recipient wallets. This feature:

- Makes chain analysis significantly more difficult
- Creates uncertainty about which wallets belong to the same entity
- Distributes funds in randomized proportions for enhanced obfuscation
- Maintains plausible deniability about wallet relationships

## Getting Started

### Initial Setup

1. **Install a Compatible Wallet**: BlackoutSOL works with Phantom, Solflare, and other Solana wallets

2. **Connect to the BlackoutSOL Interface**: Visit [https://blackoutsol.io](https://blackoutsol.io) and connect your wallet

3. **Plan Your Wallet Structure**: For optimal privacy, create 3-6 different recipient wallets in advance

### Making Your First Privacy-Enhanced Transaction

1. **Click "New Transfer"** on the BlackoutSOL interface

2. **Enter the Transfer Amount**:
   - The minimum transfer amount is 0.1 SOL
   - Be aware that fees and reserve will be calculated automatically

3. **Add Multiple Recipient Wallets**:
   - Add your primary recipient wallet (required)
   - Add 2-5 additional recipient wallets (recommended for enhanced privacy)
   - The interface will warn you if fewer than 3 wallets are provided

4. **Review the Transaction Details**:
   - Verify the total amount (including fees and reserve)
   - Check the distribution of recipient wallets
   - Review the privacy level indicator (higher with more recipient wallets)

5. **Authorize the Transaction**:
   - Confirm using your wallet's signing mechanism
   - The transaction will begin its multi-hop journey

6. **Monitor Progress** (optional):
   - The dashboard shows the percentage completion of your transfer
   - No personal information is revealed in this process

## Privacy Best Practices

### Optimal Wallet Configuration

For maximum privacy benefit, follow these guidelines:

1. **Use 3-6 Recipient Wallets**: The system supports up to 6 destination wallets, with at least 3 recommended for optimal privacy.

2. **One-Time Wallets**: For highest security, consider using fresh wallet addresses for each transaction.

3. **Maintain Separation**: Don't immediately transfer funds between your recipient wallets after receiving them.

4. **Staggered Usage**: Use funds from different recipient wallets at different times rather than simultaneously.

### Understanding Fee Structure

When using BlackoutSOL, several types of fees apply:

1. **Transaction Fees**: Standard Solana network fees for each hop.

2. **Reserve**: A small percentage (2%) held temporarily as part of the privacy mechanism.

3. **Service Fee**: A small fee to sustain the BlackoutSOL protocol.

The interface will always display the complete fee breakdown before you confirm any transaction.

## Advanced Features

### Transfer Validation

Each BlackoutSOL transfer includes cryptographic proof validation to ensure:

- The correct amount is transferred across hops
- Only the intended recipient(s) can claim the funds
- All privacy constraints are maintained

### Refund Mechanism

If a transfer fails at any point, the refund mechanism will automatically:

1. Return 95% of the funds to the sender
2. Retain 5% as a processing fee

Refunds are processed securely and maintain the same privacy guarantees.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Insufficient Funds**: Ensure your wallet has enough SOL to cover the transfer amount plus all fees and reserve.

2. **Transfer Stuck**: If a transfer appears stuck, wait at least 15 minutes before attempting the refund process.

3. **Wallet Connection Issues**: If your wallet disconnects, reconnect and refresh the page. Your transaction state will be preserved.
